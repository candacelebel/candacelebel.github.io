        "The view, photographed from an elevated camera position, looks down on a very crowded New York City street market. Rows of pushcarts and street vendors' vehicles can be seen. The precise location is difficult to ascertain, but it is certainly on the Lower East Side, probably on or near Hester Street, which at the turn of the century was the center of commerce for New York's Jewish ghetto. Located south of Houston Street and east of the Bowery, the ghetto population was predominantly Russian, but included immigrants from Austria, Germany, Rumania and Turkey. According to a description in a 1901 newspaper, an estimated 1,500 pushcart peddlers were licensed to sell wares (primarily fish) in the vicinity of Hester Street. At one point the film seems to follow three official looking men (one in a uniform) as they walk among the crowd. They may be New York City health inspectors, who apparently monitored the fish vendors closely",

There is a pond in the foreground of the picture on the shores of which the home stretch of the race takes place.

        "Filmed on an unidentified street in New York City, probably Fifth Avenue. Rows of men wearing the white uniforms of New York City street sweepers (known as White Wings) march by the camera. Each row has a police escort. The parade of uniformed men continues until several hundred pass. Immediately following the marching men come approximately a hundred horse-drawn two-wheel carts of the kind used for hauling garbage. One four wheeled cart is seen near the end of the film. In 1895, under the reform administration of Mayor William L. Strong, New York City's Department of Street Cleaning was headed by Colonel George Waring. It was he who garbed his workers in the white duck suits (earning them the name \"White Wings\") seen in the film. He is also recognized as a brilliant sanitary engineer who marshalled the two thousand man force to clean four hundred and fifty miles of streets each day. According to Jacob Riis, \"his broom saved more lives in the crowded tenements than a squad of doctors.\" By 1903, the date of the filming, a new city administration was in power and Waring had been replaced",

President Roosevelt's Cabinet forms in line on either side of the walk. The Admirals of the Navy and the Generals of the Army form lines in their rear. President Roosevelt takes his place at the head of the Cabinet and immediately the body emerges from the front door, borne on the shoulders of the soldiers and sailors. As it passes through the lines of Diplomats, Admirals and Generals, all heads are uncovered. The sailors and soldiers descend the steps slowly to the sidewalk and then the body is placed in the hearse. Here we secured another life size view. The hearse starts slowly away and President Roosevelt and his Cabinet walk toward their carriages. Then with the aid of our panoramic device we followed the hearse until it passed slowly out of view down Market Street. This scene dissolves into a picture of the body leaving the church at Canton borne on the shoulders of the sailors and soldiers and placed again in the hearse. From the time the casket appears at the church door it does not pass out of the view of our camera until the doors of the hearse are closed upon it. We follow it constantly with our panoramic device, and the views are perfect and life size. The hearse finally starts away for the cemetery, followed by the famous Black Horse Cavalry, Troop A, of Ohio"

        "This film was photographed from a boat heading south along the eastern shore of Blackwell's Island (known today as Roosevelt Island). The island lies in the East River, between Manhattan (which can be seen in the background) and Long Island City, Queens. It is approximately one and three-quarters of a mile long, extending from 51st Street to 88th, and at the time of the filming was the location for a number of New York City's charitable and penal institutions. The film opens showing the lighthouse at the north end of the island (Hallet's Cove). As the boat enters the east channel of the river, the stacks of a large brewery on Manhattan are visible in the distance. The camera pans along the island's granite seawall (built by inmates of the Penitentiary and Workhouse) and the following buildings, in order of appearance, are shown: the New York City Lunatic Asylum; the Workhouse; the Almshouse; piers for the Queensborough (or 59th Street) Bridge, which upon completion in 1908 will span 135 feet above the island; the Almshouse Keeper's House (originally the home of the Blackwell family, who had once owned the island); the Penitentiary; Charity Hospital. The film ends before reaching the southern tip of the island"

        "This excerpt shows a demonstration by the famous fireboat \"New Yorker.\" The picture shows the fireboat with all its nozzles spurting water as it goes back and forth in front of the camera. Put in service on February 1, 1891 as Engine Company 57, the \"New Yorker\" was stationed at the Battery near Castle Garden, where her crew lived aboard. She was 125 feet long, 25 feet abeam, with a tonnage of 243. The 800 horsepower triple expansion engine turned a single screw. With a total capacity of 13,000 gallons per minute from its Clapp & Jones and La France fire pumps, the \"New Yorker\" was the most powerful fireboat in the world. When Admiral Dewey came to New York with the flagship \"Olympia\" after the battle of Manilla Bay, the \"New Yorker\" led the water parade of hundreds of craft. Built at a cost of 98,250 dollars, the \"New Yorker\" remained in service until 1931",

Another camera position includes the immediate family in their carriages preceding the hearse carrying the body of the president [end of part 2].

        "From a contemporary Edison film company catalog: PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S FUNERAL CORTEGE AT BUFFALO, N.Y. The following series of pictures shows the complete movements of the funeral cortege from President Milburn's house on Delaware Avenue, Buffalo, N.Y. to the City Hall. Each separate scene as enumerated below dissolves one into the other. The picture will be sold as a complete series with dissolving effects or the separate parts will be sold as described below. This starts with the funeral procession leaving the Milburn house on Delaware Avenue, Buffalo, N.Y., headed by the mounted police of Buffalo, followed by Companies I and F, of the 14th U.S. Infantry, under personal command of Major General John R. Brooke. Following them come a company of the 73d Coast Artillery, which was then on duty at the Pan-American Exposition. The National Guard of the State of New York, consisting of picked companies from the 74th and 65th Regiments, were also in line. These march to the music of the 14th United States Infantry Band. The Military Escort was followed by the Naval Contingent given below. Fifty sailors from the United States Gunboat Michigan, under command of Lieut. Minix. After them come the blue jackets with open throat shirts showing their bronze breasts, their loose black neck scarfs and sailor knots, with yellow leggings and jackey hats [end of part 1]. Immediately following the sailors come the carriages containing President Roosevelt, U.S. Senator Mark Hanna, Senator Chauncey Depew, President Milburn, of the Pan-American Exposition, and Secretary Cortelyou, and following these is the hearse containing the body of the President drawn by four black horses and escorted by sixteen sailors and marines from the U.S. Gunboat Michigan. President McKinley's hearse is followed by many carriages containing officials and mourners. Immediately the funeral cortege passed out of view, our circular panoramic device was put into motion and a panoramic view of the Milburn house, where President McKinley died, was secured. The vast crowds are also shown in the picture, with the press and military tents in the background [end of part 2; part 3 not described]"

The second camera position shows the inaugural party during the swearing-in ceremonies. All that can be seen is the black draped balcony and, in the distance, two people standing facing one another, as if they were part of the administration of the oath. The film ends as the newly inaugurated president begins his speech",
        "From a contemporary Edison film company catalog: PRESIDENT McKINLEY TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE. This picture opens by showing the Diplomatic Corps, accompanied by Admiral Dewey and General Nelson A. Miles, coming down the carpeted stone steps of the Capitol and going to their seats in front of the stand where the President speaks. Next come the members of the President's Cabinet, and they are followed closely by President McKinley, preceded by Sergeant-at-Arms Ransdell of the Senate, bare headed and one armed, and also accompanied by the joint committee of Congress, composed of Senator Mark Hanna, of Ohio; Senator Spooner, of Wisconsin; Senator James K. Jones, of Arkansas; Representatives Cannon, of Illinois; Dalzell, of Pennsylvania, and McRae, of Arkansas. The President then steps promptly to the front of the stand amid the cheers of the immense crowd who stand with heads reverently uncovered, filling the entire foreground of our picture. As the tumult ceases, Chief Justice Melville W. Fuller, in the black silk robes of his high office, steps forward and holding in his outstretched hand a small Bible, administers the oath of office. The oath taken, the President presses his lips to the Bible and with manuscript in hand, immediately begins his speech. Again the valuable and exclusive privileges granted us by the United States Government allowed us to place our camera within fifteen feet of the President when he took the oath of office. We regret that we were unable to secure a longer film than listed above, but the rain began falling in torrents with almost the first words of the President's speech, which of course prohibited our taking a greater length of film, but notwithstanding the fact that it began sprinkling before the President took the oath of office, the fifty feet of film which we did secure is good"

        "The photographer covered the subject, the funeral cortege of President McKinley, from many different positions along the line of march. The people shown are those who preceded the hearse and those who followed after it. First come the walking military (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, National Guard) [end of part 2], and then ranking military dignitaries who immediately precede the hearse. Following the escorted hearse are the two closed carriages, containing the President's immediate family. After the carriages, are more mourners on foot, representing various countries. There is some film taken from one of the wings of the Capitol overlooking the courtyard of that building",
        "From a contemporary Edison film company catalog: PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S FUNERAL CORTEGE AT WASHINGTON, D.C. When photographing the funeral of President McKinley we secured an excellent position at the foot of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., having had the exclusive right for animated picture apparatus inside the lines. Our camera is focused looking up Pennsylvania Avenue and shows countless thousands of mourning people who line the streets along the way. As the funeral procession which accompanies the body of our martyred President approaches, our camera is set in motion and pictures of the marching multitude who pay the last tribute to President McKinley at our National Capitol are recorded in the following order. The line is headed by a troop of U.S. Cavalry, followed by detachments of heavy artillery [end of part 1]; then comes the Loyal Legion, followed by G. A. R. detachments, made up of both Federal and Confederate veterans. Next in order comes the Guard of Honor [end of part 2], who are in turn followed by the hearse, which is drawn by six black-plumed and black-netted horses. Inside the hearse can be seen the flag covered casket. The light and color of the procession is suddenly gone; spectators silently bow and bare their heads. The pageant has suddenly been transformed into a funeral cortege. Our position was so excellent that as the hearse passed our camera a distinct and life-size view was procured, showing this vehicle of sadness in all its detail. The hearse is closely followed by the Admirals of the Navy and the Generals of the Army. Next in order come the carriages of the family and the relatives, and then the carriage of President Roosevelt, which is drawn by four black horses. Next come the carriages which contain the President's Cabinet, the Diplomatic Corps, Chief Justice Fuller and Associate Justices, Senators, Congressman, Governors of States and Government Officials. These carriages are followed by the United States Marine Band, which forms a most imposing spectacle as it marches slowly and solemnly to the strains of \"Nearer My God to Thee.\" Following the United States Marine Band and in step with the slow funeral march comes the National Guard of the District of Columbia and sailors from United States Battleships, clad in their natty uniforms and jackey hats. The sailors and soldiers are marching sixteen abreast and make a very imposing spectacle as they pass our camera [sequence from the Marine Band to sailors appears in part 2]. The procession having passed, the crowd immediately surges toward the Capitol, intent on securing a place in the line that they may enter the rotunda and look upon the face of the illustrious President McKinley. Our panoramic device is then set in motion and a most perfect and interesting picture is secured as an ending to the Washington film. The picture shows the immense crowds surging toward the Capitol, and as rain begins falling at that moment tens of thousands of umbrellas are raised for protection. Our camera having been above the heads of the people, a most novel effect is secured. As the camera rotates, the base and steps of the Capitol are brought into view and the crowd is shown crushing and struggling for entrance to the rotunda. One of the most perfect of the McKinley funeral pictures"

        "Gravity is the most powerful and exacting force in the universe. It is pervasive and penetrating. Gravity binds us together, its reach hangs stars in the sky and its grip crushes light. Gravity holds planets together, and leashes them to their suns. Without gravity, stars, comets, moons, nebulae, and even the Earth itself would not exist. Explore how science and humanity discovered, overcame and utilized gravity. Learn what it takes to propel objects into the heavens, to ride a wave or to ski down a slope. Take a front row seat as an astronaut subjects himself to the weightless wonders of the specially modified aircraft used to train astronauts known as the \"Vomit Comet.\""

The mayor of New York was Seth Low, a lame-duck at the time of filming, having been defeated in November, 1903 by George B. McClellan. The Williamsburg Bridge, a combined cantilever and suspension bridge, crosses the East River from Delancey and Clinton Streets, Manhattan, to Roebling and S. 5th Streets, Williamsburg. Built at a cost of twelve million dollars, it held two lanes of roadway, two \"L\" tracks, four trolley tracks, and two promenades. It was the largest suspension bridge in the world at the time"

But the records don't stop there, the Atacama is also the oldest desert in the world, recently it has been dated to an amazing 150 million years old. Other research shows that it's surface is also incredibly ancient - there are boulders lying in this desert that have not moved for over 23 million years - that's over 50 times longer than it's taken for our human species to evolve. The soil is so dry that it has been used as a test bed for the Mars rovers. Once thought completely lifeless, strange bacteria discovered in the desert have given scientists new hope that they might find life on the red planet. Atacama is also home to the largest copper mine in the world. HOW THE EARTH WAS MADE looks into the riddle of the Atacama and uncovers how this extraordinarily dry landscape was created.\"--Back cover of original DVD case"

Located on the East River north of Hell Gate between the Bronx and Queens, Riker's Island was the site of a massive New York City landfill operation at the time of the filming (originally eighty-seven acres, by 1939 the size of the island had increased to four hundred acres). The film includes scenes of heavy equipment at work, including pile drivers constructing the seawall and steam shovels unloading rubbish from barges. On one of the steam shovels, a sign reading \"Water Front Improvement Co., 220 Broadway, New York\" can be distinguished. Near the end of the film, a narrow-gauge steam engine with five open cars loaded with landfill, comes into view. The island is currently the site of a New York City penitentiary"

        "The film begins by showing railroad cars in the foreground with the overshadowing walls of a state prison in the background. The second camera position, from a higher elevation, pans slowly showing the yard interior of the prison and some of the large buildings. There is a dissolve from the exterior to the interior, a set of a stone wall with an iron barred door. Uniformed men are visible; they open the door and remove a man in civilian clothes. The camera then dissolves to another set in which there is a chair with wires attached. The man in civilian clothes is brought in and strapped to the chair. At the end of the film, two of the six witnesses examine him with stethoscopes",
        "From a contemporary Edison film company catalog: ELECTROCUTION OF CZOLGOSZ. . A detailed reproduction of the execution of the assassin of President McKinley faithfully carried out from the description of an eye witness. The picture is in three scenes. First: Panoramic view of Auburn Prison taken the morning of the electrocution. The picture then dissolves into the corridor of murderer's row. The keepers are seen taking Czolgosz from his cell to the death chamber, and shows State Electrician, Wardens and Doctors making final test of the chair. Czolgosz is then brought in by the guard and is quickly strapped into the chair. The current is turned on at a signal from the Warden, and the assassin heaves heavily as though the straps would break. He drops prone after the current is turned off. The doctors examine the body and report to the Warden that he is dead, and he in turn officially announces the death to the witness"

        "This film shows the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906, and the devastation resulting from the subsequent three-day fire. The 8.3 magnitude earthquake struck at 5:12am and was centered along the San Andreas Fault, which slices through coastal California. Most of the cities of central California were badly damaged. San Francisco, with thousands of unreinforced brick buildings - and thousands more closely-spaced wooden Victorian dwellings - was poorly prepared for a major fire. Collapsed buildings, broken chimneys, and a shortage of water due to broken mains led to several large fires that soon coalesced into a city-wide holocaust. The fire swept over nearly a quarter of the city, including the entire downtown area. Dynamite was used with varying success to prevent the fire from spreading westward. Over 3,000 people are now estimated to have died as a result of the disaster. For the surviving refugees, the first few weeks were hard; as aid poured in from around the country, thousands slept in tents in city parks, and all citizens were asked to do their cooking in the street. A severe shortage of public transportation made a taxicab out of anything on wheels. Numerous businesses relocated teporarily in Oakland and many refugees found lodgings outside the city. Reconstruction of the city proceeded at a furious pace and by 1908, San Francisco was well on the way to recovery. The scenes in the film are preceded by titles, many of which are sensationalized. One entire scene showing a family eating in the street was almost certainly staged for the camera. The film was probably made in early May, as one scene can be precisely dated to May 9, and another to sometime after May 1"

        "President Roosevelt reviewed the school children of San Francisco from 10:00am to 10:30am on Wednesday, May 13, 1903. An estimated 40,000 school children gathered along both sides of Van Ness Avenue, west of the downtown area, for the parade. The wide north-south boulevard, partially lined with the mansions of the wealthy, was the approximate boundary between the old gold rush era city (to the east) and the newer western addition to the west. To better organize the students, each school was assigned a specific block and each student was given a flag to wave. Many adults were also on hand to watch the parade, which entered Van Ness at Pacific Avenue, proceeded south to Market Street, then doubled back up Van Ness to Pacific. The presidential carriage kept to the right so that all the children could get a good view of the President",
        "The following is a scene-by-scene description of the film: The camera was positioned on the southeast corner of O'Farrell Street and Van Ness Avenue, and pans from north to west to south, and then back to west. The view is north on Van Ness Avenue toward the approaching band and cavalry. Students of Whittier School are in the foreground. The band passing at left is led by conductor Paul Steindorff. Following the band are the Cleveland Grays, a noted black cavalry troop, led by Captain Young, the first black graduate of West Point. After a cut in the continuity of the film, the President's carriage approaches along the west side of the avenue. Behind cheering crowds rises the Baltimore Family Hotel at Geary Street and Van Ness Avenue. Students of the Moulder, Laguna Honda, and Oceanside Schools wave from the steps of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral (1891) as the President passes. The cathedral burned in 1962, and the new cathedral (1971) stands two blocks to the west. The view is west up O'Farrell Street as the President passes, waving his top hat. Students of Hearst School wave from the steps of Victorian homes. An officer of the 9th U.S. Cavalry follows the Presidential carriage. The narrow, wooden tower may be a converted windmill. Following another cut in the film, the return sequence begins. The camera looks south to see students of Rincon and Jefferson schools welcoming the returning presidential carriage. In the background are the towers of St. Ignatius Church on Hayes Street. In the middle at right are some of the mansions along Van Ness Avenue. The President passes, looking rather tired. Secret Service agents walk with the carriage"

        "Explore the debate that led to the new TV rating system in this illuminating look at the influence of violence on television. It is one of the longest-running debates in America does TV violence spill over into real life? A mountain of conflicting statistics clouds the question, but a recent survey shows that over 80% of Americans believe there is a link. Go to the heart of the debate that led to the newly-instituted TV rating system. In revealing interviews, people on both sides of the issue present their case. Hear from Senator Paul Simon--a longtime opponent of TV violence--CBS president Howard Stringer and former FCC chairman Newton Minow, and explore the latest reports from long-time researchers of TV violence. Clips from some of America's most popular shows trace the changing face of TV violence, and the producers and stars of some of the most violent programs on television speak out. From the birth of TV to the action groups who are trying to change the face of entertainment in America, this is a sweeping look at PRIME TIME VIOLENCE"

In this picture we show President Roosevelt and Cabinet standing at the station with bare heads, while the casket of President McKinley is being placed in the hearse. As the hearse leaves the station the President and his Cabinet start for their carriages. Our panoramic device is here started and this picture finishes with a circular panorama of the Canton station and Public Square. The picture here presented of President Roosevelt is the best one ever recorded. He is very close to the camera and shown life size and can be instantly recognized"

        "This film is a compilation of views and pans among the ruins of San Francisco after the earthquake and fire and dates from Wednesday, May 9, 1906. The film was shot in the downtown area along Market and Mission streets",
        "The following is a scene-by-scene description of the film: [Frame: 0100] The camera, positioned at the southwest corner of Mission and 5th streets, makes a hurried and jerky pan from the east side of 5th Street eastward to the south side of Mission Street. At the start of the pan, the ruined Lincoln School building is seen, with the dark profile of the Flood Building behind it on Market Street. The camera pans right on a long row of windows in the ruined west wall of the Emporium department store [0130]. The tent in the foreground is probably a temporary \"office\" of the business formerly on the site. The pan continues further right and looks northeast down Mission Street. [0338] The Rialto Building stands in the distance. The camera pans farther right, to another tent and a sign -- \"Safes opened 105 5th Street\" [0420]. Many safes fused shut in the heat of the fire and others had to be cooled for weeks before being opened. [0441] The camera is at the southwest corner of 4th and Market streets, looking northeast across Market Street in afternoon light. The Mutual Savings Bank (two blank walls) is in the background at Geary/Kearny and Market streets. The street traffic is part of the afternoon commute down Market Street to the Ferry Building. [0485] Note the heavily-laden wagon (perhaps containing a family's possessions) and the Sanitary Laundry Company wagon. [1638] The camera captures a traffic jam on Market Street. The view is probably north, across Market Street just east of California Street, in the afternoon. The laying of streetcar tracks along this section of Market Street may be the cause of the bottleneck. [1835] The view is northwest, near the southwest corner of East and Market streets, just west of the Ferry Building. A heavily-laden streetcar approaches the Ferry Building. [1908] Note the beggar on crutches. [2075] In the hazy background are Nob Hill and the south slope of Russian Hill (right). [2135] The view is approximately the same as the previous segment, with a streetcar beginning its run up Market Street. [2814] Note the sailor patrolling with fixed bayonet. In the hazy distance unburnt dwellings on the summit of Russian Hill are visible. Nob Hill is in the distance, with the rectangular silhouette of the Fairmont Hotel. [3000] In this very brief scene the camera focuses on workers removing debris. The view is east on Mission Street between 4th and 3rd streets, just east of St. Patrick's Church, part of which is visible at left. [3075] The camera pans to show the demolition of the facade of St. Patrick's Church. The camera is southwest of the church on Mission Street between 4th and 3rd streets. After a brief view of ruins along Market Street, the camera pans right (eastward) past two men near a fire engine [3270], to the church facade being demolished [3957]. Of particular interest is the cameraman seen in the foreground filming the action. He is photographing the film titled San Francisco Earthquake and Fire, April 18, 1906"

        "On Mar. 4, 1905, TR is inaugurated in Washington, D.C. with much celebration and fanfare. TR rides in an open landau on Fifteenth St., NW, escorted by mounted Rough Riders; Secret Service men and detectives walk on either side of the carriage; TR tips his hat to the crowd. Sitting beside him is Sen. John C. Spooner of Wis., Chairman of the joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. Opposite, but not clearly visible, are Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge of Mass. and Rep. John Dalzell of Penn., members of the committee. Second sequence consists of long shots of TR taking the oath of office on a platform erected on the east front of the Capitol; Chief Justice Melville Weston Fuller (1888-1910) administers the Presidential oath of office as Chief Clerk of the Supreme Court James H. McKenney holds the Bible. The platform is decorated with plants and garlands and a large banner with the American eagle on it hangs from the center of the railing. West Point cadets and Annapolis midshipmen are assembled below the platform"
