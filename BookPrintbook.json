It includes communities of Germans far beyond its borders, and it emphasizes that for generations many who considered themselves to be German also felt themselves to be other things. Taking up a decidedly counter-hegemonic position, Glenn calls for a greater integration of mobilities, migration flows, and pluralities of belonging into our narratives of Germans' histories. He also argues for greater attention to the transcultural spaces many Germans helped to fashion and the various networks that tied them together.\"-- Author's web page"

    "\"The so-called Slovak question asked what place Slovaks held-or should have held-in the former state of Czechoslovakia. Formed in 1918 at the end of World War I from the remains of the Hungarian Empire, and reformed after ceasing to exist during World War II, the country would eventually split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia after the \"Velvet Divorce\" in 1993. In the meantime, the minority Slovaks often clashed with the majority Czechs over their role in the nation. The Slovak Question examines this debate from a transatlantic perspective. Explored through the relationship between Slovaks, Americans of Slovak heritage, and United States and Czechoslovakian policymakers, it shows how Slovak national activism in America helped the Slovaks establish a sense of independent identity and national political assertion after World War I. It also shows how Slovak American leaders influenced US policy by conceptualizing the United States and Slovakia as natural allies due to their connections through immigration. This process played a critical role in undermining attempts to establish a united Czechoslovakian identity and instead caused a divide between the two groups, which was exploited by Nazi Germany and then by other actors during the Cold War, and proved ultimately to be insurmountable\"-- Provided by publisher"

    "Between 1776 and 1783, Britain hired an estimated 30,000 German soldiers to fight in its war against the Americans. Collectively known as Hessians, they actually came from six German territories within the Holy Roman Empire. Over the course of the war, members of the German corps, including women and children, spent extended periods of time in locations as dispersed and varied as Canada in the North to West Florida and Cuba in the South. They shared in every significant British military triumph and defeat. Thousands died of disease, were killed in battle, were captured by the enemy, or deserted. Collectively, they recorded their experiences and observations of the war they fought in, the land they traversed, and the people they encountered in a large body of letters, diaries, and similar private and official records"

    "Focuses on multiple comparisons of proportions in multi-sample models with Bernoulli responses. First, the author explains the one-sample and two-sample methods that form the basis of multiple comparisons. Then, regularity conditions are stated in detail. Simultaneous inference for all proportions based on exact confidence limits and based on asymptotic theory is discussed. Closed testing procedures based on some one-sample statistics are introduced. For all-pairwise multiple comparisons of proportions, the author uses arcsine square root transformation of sample means. Closed testing procedures based on maximum absolute values of some two-sample test statistics and based on chi-square test statistics are introduced. It is shown that the multi-step procedures are more powerful than single-step procedures and the RyanEinotGabrielWelsch (REGW)-type tests. Furthermore, the author discusses multiple comparisons with a control. Under simple ordered restrictions of proportions, the author also discusses closed testing procedures based on maximum values of two-sample test statistics and based on Bartholomew's statistics. Last, serial gatekeeping procedures based on the above-mentioned closed testing procedures are proposed although Bonferroni inequalities are used in serial gatekeeping procedures of many"

    "\"Stabilizing Fragile States is about intervening to help fragile states stabilize in the face of internal challenges that threaten national security and how the United States can do better at less cost with improved chances of success. Recent US involvements have ranged in intensity and size from Colombia, which did not put American boots on the ground, to massive interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, which did. The lack of success in Afghanistan and Iraq has tended to dominate the national conversation about dealing with fragile states. Helping stabilize fragile states has been too much of a poorly informed, impersonal, technocratic and conflicted process, dominated by reactions to events and missing a more human approach tailored to various countries' circumstances. In this book, Rufus Phillips explains why we have not been more successful and what it would take to make this form of foreign intervention effective and sustainable\"-- Provided by publisher"

Where previous studies have sought to decode his work, expounding its symbolic meanings by references to Yeats's occult beliefs, philosophical ideas or political ideology, the focus here is on his poetic technique, its typical forms and their implications for the understanding of the poems. Grene is concerned with the distinctive stylistic signatures of the Collected Poems: the use of dates and place names within individual poems; the handling of demonstratives and of grammatical tense and mood; certain nodal Yeatsian words ('dream', 'bitter', 'sweet') and images (birds and beasts); dialogue and monologue as the voices of his dramatic lyrics. The aim throughout is to illustrate the shifting and unstable movement between lived reality and transcendental thought in Yeats, the embodied quality of his poetry between a phenomenal world of sight and an imagined world of vision\" -- Provided by publisher"

    "\"This book provides a detailed description of the application of mathematical learning curve modeling to analyze the state of learning and memory in humans and animals. The purpose of the book is to enable the readers to apply the knowledge gained in their own research on learning and memory. The authors hope that the readers may achieve success in this field of knowledge, expand and advance mathematical modeling of the learning curve, and that this book may aid in this process. For this, the authors have developed their own mathematical model based on the systems theory and proved its advantage in relation to those previously proposed. The authors developed MS Windows application \"Learning Curve Modeling Tool\" to help the reader modeling the learning curve from raw learning data in the California Verbal Learning Test, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and other similar memory tests. Moreover, the book describes in detail the Windows and Android application \"Memory Monitoring Tool\", developed by the authors, which is suited well for mathematical modeling of the learning curves. The application aims to reveal initial signs of memory impairment. Besides, the section APPENDIX A describes a Web application - \"Learning curve simulator\" - developed by the authors for helping readers to get started with practically modeling the learning curve and testing their memory. This application is included in the book. The book will be useful for undergraduate students, graduate students, advanced graduate students, and professors, especially for professors who work on learning in both humans and animals, and those interested in the memory of marijuana users, alcoholics, and those suffering from diabetes and multiple sclerosis, as well as other neurological and psychological diseases and their neurological complications including those after COVID-19\"-- Provided by publisher"

    "\"Thomas Pfau's study of images and visual experience is a tour de force linking Platonic metaphysics to modern phenomenology and probing literary, philosophical, and theological accounts of visual experience from Plato to Rilke. Incomprehensible Certainty presents a sustained reflection on the nature of images and the phenomenology of visual experience. Taking the \"image\" (eiko\u0304n) as the essential medium of art and literature and as foundational for the intuitive ways in which we make contact with our \"lifeworld,\" Thomas Pfau draws in equal measure on Platonic metaphysics and modern phenomenology to advance a series of interlocking claims. First, Pfau shows that, beginning with Plato's later dialogues, being and appearance came to be understood as ontologically distinct from (but no longer opposed to) one another. Second, in contrast to the idol that is typically gazed at and visually consumed as an object of desire, this study positions the image (eiko\u0304n) as a medium whose intrinsic abundance and excess reveal to us its metaphysical function, namely, as the visible analogue of an invisible, numinous reality. Finally, the interpretations unfolded in this book (from Plato, Plotinus, Pseudo-Dionysius, John Damascene via Bernard of Clairvaux, Bonaventure, Julian of Norwich, and Nicholas of Cusa to modern writers and artists such as Goethe, Ruskin, Turner, Hopkins, Ce\u0301zanne, and Rilke) affirm the essential complementarity of image and word, visual intuition and hermeneutic practice, in theology, philosophy, and literature. Like Pfau's previous book, Minding the Modern, Incomprehensible Certainty is a major work. With over fifty illustrations, the book will interest students and scholars of philosophy, theology, literature, and art history\"-- Provided by publisher"

    "Up from the Depths tells the interconnected stories of two of the most important writers in American history--the novelist and poet Herman Melville (1819-1891) and one of his earliest biographers, the literary critic and historian Lewis Mumford (1895-1990). Deftly cutting back and forth between the writers, Aaron Sachs reveals the surprising resonances between their lives, work, and troubled times--and their uncanny relevance in our own age of crisis. The author of Moby-Dick was largely forgotten for several decades after his death, but Mumford helped spearhead Melville's revival in the aftermath of World War I and the 1918-1919 flu pandemic, when American culture needed a forebear with a suitably dark vision. As Mumford's career took off and he wrote books responding to the machine age, urban decay, world war, and environmental degradation, it was looking back to Melville's confrontation with crises such as industrialization, slavery, and the Civil War that helped Mumford to see his own era clearly. Mumford remained obsessed with Melville, ultimately helping to canonize him as America's greatest tragedian. But largely forgotten today is one of Mumford's key insights--that Melville's darkness was balanced by an inspiring determination to endure. Amid today's foreboding over global warming, racism, technology, pandemics, and other crises, Melville and Mumford remind us that we've been in this struggle for a long time. To rediscover these writers today is to rediscover how history can offer hope in dark times"

The historical survey covers the three main episodes in the evolution of that research project: its theoretical antecedents (which go back to the innovative ideas on mathematical analysis of the late 17th century) and first formulation, its consolidation as a foundationalist project of mathematical analysis, and its dissolution at the beginning of the 19th century. In addition, the book analyzes the influence of the ideas of the combinatorial school on German mathematics throughout the 19th century"

    "This book provides, for the first time, a comprehensive overview of the fundamental roles that ecological interactions play in extinction processes, bringing to light an underground of hidden pathways leading to the same dark place: biodiversity loss. We are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. We see species declining and vanishing one after another. Poached rhinos, dolphins and whales slaughtered, pandas surviving only in captivity are strong emotional testimonials of what is happening. Yet, the main threat to natural communities may be overshadowed by the disappearance of large species, with most extinctions happening unnoticed and involving less eye-catching organisms, such as parasites and pollinators. Ecosystems hide countless, invisible wires connecting organisms in dense networks of ecological interactions. Through these networks, perturbations can propagate from one species to another, producing unpredictable effects. In worst case scenarios, the loss of one species might doom many others to extinction. Ecologists now consider such mechanisms as a fundamental and still poorly understood - driver of the ongoing biodiversity crisis. Hidden Pathways to Extinction makes the invisible links connecting the fates of species and organisms evident, exploring why complexity can enhance ecosystem stability and yet accelerate species loss. Page after page, Strona provides convincing evidence that we are primarily responsible for the fall in biodiversity, that we are falling too, and that we need to redouble our conservation efforts now, or it won't be long before we hit the ground"

    "\"Sustainability is crucial for the future of our societies. From a computing perspective, the challenge is to design IT artifacts that contribute to improving people's work and everyday life in a sustainable way, thereby also contributing to social and ecological sustainability. The book documents the experiences made by several leading research groups in Europe, North America and South Africa, describing their efforts to achieve sustainable design results, the difficulties that barred the way but also the strategies they adopted to achieve the goal of sustainability. The analysis of this rich empirical material helps thinking about how to more systematically address and possibly overcome the impediments to achieving a design result that is sustainable in practice. It points at the importance of considering the socio-technical nature of innovation, to focus on the relationship between ownership, appropriation and learning early on in a project, and to strive not only for technological flexibility but take care of issues of maintenance repair in designing computer-support. The book discusses the changes that would be necessary to make the main stakeholders in IT design more open to creating environments for sustainable innovation. The examples discussed in this book and their analysis can inspire researchers, institutions, managers, ICT professionals and educators to promote the goal of sustainable design results and increase the overall awareness of its strategic relevance\"-- Provided by publisher"

    "\"In the middle of unprecedented, ongoing national political polarization, local governments carry on their work of deliberating, administrating, and running the official structures of cities. City council meetings are often where seemingly mundane issues take on epic proportions, and where democracy moves forward in its clunky, wildly imperfect way. How much is a local government meeting an exercise in democracy, and how much is it an exercise in impression management? In 2009, theater artist Aaron Landsman was dragged by a friend to a city council meeting in Portland, Oregon. At first he was bored, but when a citizen dumped trash in front of the council in order to show how the city needed cleaning up, he was rapt. He saw for the first time how our civic bodies often result in a performance of democracy as much as the real thing. He began attending local government meetings across the country, interviewing council members, staffers, activists and other citizens, using an ethnographic method. Out of this initial investigation, Landsman and director Mallory Catlett developed a participatory theater piece called City Council Meeting in five US cities-from New York City to Houston, Keene New Hampshire to San Francisco. They worked with local partners to create endings in each city about issues on the ground and trained local staffers to take audiences through the experience. Along the way they got some things right, made mistakes and learned ways to approach community engagement across geographic, racial and class lines. Five years later Catlett and Landsman returned to local partners in each city to reflect together on what the impact of the project was, how it could have been better, and what they got right. No One is Qualified looks at how we make art with communities, how we perform power and who gets to play which roles, and how we might use creativity and rigorous inquiry to look at our structures of democracy anew. This book is ideal for interdisciplinary humanities courses, socially-engaged theater-making programs, and cross-disciplinary programs in sociology/ethnography, philosophy, politics and live performing arts\"-- Provided by publisher"

    "Propaganda is the science of convincing an audience without appealing to reason. Over the past centuries, anti-Russian propaganda has been founded on juxtaposing the West and Russia as European versus Asiatic, civilized versus barbaric, modern versus backward, liberal versus autocratic, and even good versus evil. Russia has therefore throughout history been allowed to play one of two roles -- either an apprentice of Western civilization by accepting the subordinate role as the student and political object, or a threat that must be contained or defeated. While propaganda has the positive effect of promoting unity and mobilizing resources against an adversary, it has the negative effect of creating irrational decision-making and obstructing a workable peace.

This \"domestic captivity\" is intimately connected to England's substantial involvement in the systematic enslavement of kidnapped Africans, even as early fictional narratives ignore the experience of enslaved people. The book looks at canonical authors such as Aphra Behn, Richard Steele, and Eliza Haywood, as well as popular writers such as Penelope Aubin and Edward Kimber\"-- Provided by publisher"

It includes biographies and a historical-scientific analysis of the main research topics investigated by world-renowned physicists such as Aldo Pontremoli, Giovanni Polvani, Giovanni Gentile Jr., Beppo Occhialini, and Piero Caldirola, highlighting their contributions to the development of Italian physics in a national and international context. Further, the book provides a historical perspective on the interplay of physics and politics in Italy during both the Fascist regime and the postwar reconstruction period, which led to the creation of the CISE (Centro Informazioni Studi Esperienze, a research center for applied nuclear physics, funded by private industries) in 1946, and of the Milan division of the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) in 1951"

    "This book tells a story of masculinity through the experiences of one boy, Adam. From four different studies and time periods, it tracks moments of significance in his life over a period of 20 years. These moments highlight the ways in which Adam is both drawn towards and away from a hegemonic masculinity of physical toughness, domination, competition and an opposition to the feminine. The book is set against the backdrop of a long history of contentious gender politics in Australia and globally but particularly responds to the renewed attention to the social construction of masculinities in the current #MeToo climate. Against this backdrop, nuanced and longitudinal accounts of boys' and men's experiences of masculinity are significant because they can offer insight into the complex bodily, social, economic, and historical forces that configure masculinities. Such understandings are important in our endeavours as those who educate, support and work with boys and men to transform gender inequalities"

To explore this problem, 50 short cases are presented and discussed to analyze and reflect on what tacit knowledge is, how it is developed, transferred and integrated, to improve performance. Tacit knowledge is hard to codify and specify, yet these short cases will demystify how tacit knowledge works in organizations and the benefits of it in relation to improving productivity and processes. The emphasis on short, easy to connect with cases in The Philosophy of Tacit Knowledge allows readers to develop their own models and policy strategies towards improving their own practice"

    "\"Legal Spectatorship examines the visual culture surrounding domestic violence, or DV, focusing on the ways that photographs are marshaled as a form of spectacular evidence rooted in slavery and antiblackness. Historically, slaves were not able to testify in person in court although they were often silent witnesses to white domestic conflicts. Today, these histories of racism are embedded into domestic violence prosecution as photographs documenting evidence of DV stand in for women's testimony, and an extensive web of surveillance and administrative tactics criminalize female victims. Kelli Moore reads the legislative, juridical, and media structures that have developed around domestic violence as an extension of the logics of slavery that points to a broader form of US \"domestic violence\" in the form of slavery and racism. The chapters take up slave witnessing and black subjectivity; the psychological theories that developed around DV in the context of the Civil Rights movement; \"artivism\" around domestic violence imagery and anti-DV campaigns; and Moore's own ethnographic work in the courtroom observing domestic violence cases\"-- Provided by publisher"

The first part of the book introduces Rancie\u0300re's interventions on democracy and politics, art and aesthetics, emancipation, and education. The second part of the book analyses how Rancie\u0300re's writing has been taken up in considerations of emancipatory, democratic, and political education, art(s) education, and innovative work in educational research. The final part of the book appraises the significance of Rancie\u0300re's writing for education and considers the difficult task of applying his insights to educational scholarship"

    "Using quantitative and qualitative evidence, Sumner shows how consumer boycotts can work to dissuade companies from donating money to politicians, but may also encourage companies to attempt influence by largely invisible means. Boycotts do not work as many people expect - by threatening sales. Instead, Sumner shows how boycotts are less a statement of consumer behaviour than a way for people to signal their political inclinations, and they primarily hurt companies by tarnishing their reputation. Political influence is about building relationships, which means that companies have many more options for influence than just PAC contributions and formal lobbying. With these options available, companies can decide how to influence politics when they need to, and the tarnish of boycotts to a company's image can push some businesses to pursue options that are less noticeable to the public"

    "\"For more than four centuries, the communities of maroons (men and women who escaped from slavery) dotted the fringes of plantation America, from Brazil through the Caribbean to the United States. Today their descendants still form semi-independent enclaves-in Jamaica, Brazil, Colombia, Belize, Suriname, Guyane, and elsewhere-remaining proud of their maroon origins and, in some cases, faithful to unique cultural traditions forged during the earliest days of Afro-American history. In 1986, expelled by the military regime of Suriname, the Prices turned to neighboring Guyane (French Guiana), where thousands of Maroons were taking refuge from the Suriname civil war. Over the next fifteen years, their conversations with local people convinced them of the need to replace the pervasive stereotypes about Maroons in Guyane with accurate information. In 2003, Les Marrons became a local best-seller. In 2020, after many further visits, the Prices wrote a new edition taking into account the many rapid changes. Maroons in Guyane reviews the history of the four Maroon peoples in Guyane, explains how these groups differ from one another, and analyzes their current situations in the bustling, multicultural world of this far-flung outpost of the French Republic. A gallery of the magnificent arts of the Maroons completes the volume\"-- Provided by publisher"
